## Local build with yarn

Make sure `yarn` is installed and ready.
According the yarn wiki enable corepack wrapper:

`corepack enable`

As we haven't made _clean_ install of the new yarn maybe you have to run:

`npm install -g yarn`

install all dependencies with:

`yarn install`

trigger the build with:

`yarn build`
